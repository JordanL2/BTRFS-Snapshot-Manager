# BTRFS-Snapshot-Manager

## TODO

* Ensure user is running as root upfront
* Investigate if it's possible to snapshot the various linux/initramfs images when creating a systemd-boot entry
* Multiple systemd-boot configs for the same subvol? If you want configs for a different reference entry, eg linux-lts
* Restore snapshot function?
